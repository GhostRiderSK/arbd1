A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a rotating or sliding contact to make it work as a potential divider. One terminal of the potentiometer is connected to Vcc and another to ground, by changing the position of centre tap different voltage levels can be obtained on the Arduino pin, A6. 
#### Exercise :
+ Interface potentiometer with Arduino and check the results on serial monitor.
