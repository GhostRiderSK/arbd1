Figure illustrates the block diagram of Arduino Board 1. It consists of Arduino Nano that operates at 5V and some basic Input/Output Peripherals that are connected with the  Arduino pins. The components are selected in such a way that you can learn a variety of experiments from the simplest experiment of blinking an LED to interfacing Arduino with your mobile phone. You can perform more than 25 experiments on this board. Experiments suggested in this manual are arranged so that you can start from scratch and learn everything in an increasingly complex pattern. Besides these experiments, you can also use this board in your own way. Arduino pins are also provided externally for any testing purposes and for using Arduino separately.
