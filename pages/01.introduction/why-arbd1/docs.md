#### Why ARBD1?
Many students start their journey with Arduino with loads of curiosity and enthusiasm but end up jumping off the boat too soon mainly due to the following reasons: 

1. A lot of components are required with time and arranging all the components is a tedious task
2. Most students including school students, different engineering branches’ students and even almost half of the electronics students struggle with hardware. They find it difficult to understand so much hardware before even using it. 
3. Circuits such as LCD connections, Charlieplexing, Multiplexing require so many connections that no matter how much care you make your connections with, some wires would still remain loose and you end up with a lot of frustration and waste a lot of time. 

With 	ArBrd1, students wouldn’t have to struggle with hardware complexity and wire connections at the beginning of their journey. Whenever your circuits don’t work, you don’t have a clue whether there is a problem in your components, in your connections or in the code. With this board, you will know for sure that there is a problem in your code whenever it does not work.
