#### How to use ARBD1
There are many ways to use this board. If you are an absolute beginner and want to learn everything step-by-step, you can follow the manual. This board and manual are designed in such a way that you can start from the very basics and learn a lot of things about Arduino, sensors, actuators and basic electronics. After getting acquainted with this board, you can make a lot of real-life applications based projects that can even interact with your surroundings and communicate with your mobile and laptop.  

If you have worked with Arduino before or don’t want to follow the manual, you can still do a lot of experiments of your own choice or from our list( listed separately in manual under “Experiments List.”) You can still use this manual as this contains a lot of information not only about Arduino but also about other interfaces and their connections.   

You can use this board for experimentation as well as project purposes. If you want to know more about circuit basics and want to design your own circuit visit blogs section Hatchnhack.com or you can also visit HatchnHack. :)
